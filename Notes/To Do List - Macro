To Do List - Macro

Database - High priority
- Figure out what to do about subdomain (nested) targets.
	 - Conditional in the run_tool* functions.
	 - If the category of the tool is subdomain_*, run extra functionality adding the subdomain to the discovered hosts.
	 - Similar process for getting the IP address from a domain.
	 - Similar process for reverse DNS
	 - Basically any process that requires creating an extra discovered host to enumerate.
- Parsing out results using GREPMONEY!
- Enter data according to scan. e.g.
{scan_time} | {tool} | {tool_output} | {alert}
with tool_output being an asset.
Assets are pieces of infomation discovered about the host. They can be:
- Associated IP address
- Open Ports
- Discovered Content
- Subdomain
- Screenshot
- Uptime check / IP discovery
- 

Performing Scans - Top Priority
- Create functions for each of the scan types.
- Test to make sure the commands themselves work
- How to parse out scan results?

Alerting - Medium priority
- functions to be called whenever a new scan takes place. NOT on a cron job, probably.
	- Need correct db functions to make work
- slack channel integration (should be simple enough)

Tools.json - Medium Priority
- meta: for scans that require extra functionalty to perform on the found assets after the scan.
	- add_domain = Adds the asset as a discovered domain
	- add_ip = Adds the asset as a disovered IP
	- create_asset_dir = Create a dir for the discovered asset
	- publish_to_web = Haven't figured out details, but should be able to add to make some kind of symlink in var/www to this folder. 
	- more would be useful!



Folder Structure - Medium Priority
-  Implementing the IP addresses and subdomain symlinked stuff
- Structuring the folders appropriately.
- Latest folder... ignore?

Web Interface - Low priority
- Login page
- Create graphs for data
- Display screenshots
- Format areas each host/target appropriately
- Probably build some kind of flask api, need to research.
- Add new scans


CLI Wrapper - Medium priorotiy
- -i flag to trigger scheduled scan immediately: gets it from the database
