To Do List - Micro

1 - Reconsider database structure:
	- Should we only have one database?
	YES! This is almost certainly best practice.
	- Which means that we need to add a target and company field to the assets.
	And any other relevant metadata, probably.
	- So how do we do it?
	Firstly, we don't need to create databases and tables as often.
	Basically starting the bbdb script again, but with new knowledge.
